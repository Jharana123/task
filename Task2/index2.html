    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>SPECTRUM ,Technical society of COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, BHUBANESWAR,a place for all technical enthusiasts to learn, discover and innovate new things in the field of Technology and Design. The name of the club " SPECTRUM ", a contribution of our alumni of 2015 batch, is particularly used to describe the characteristic colors of visible light after passing through a prism, similarly students of CET consist of different skills within them and Spectrum acts like a prism, Spectrum recognises their skills helps them to strengthen it.

        This club was established by " Bikram Keshari Panda (2015 batch) ".Spectrum got its recognition in the year 2016 and got its workspace, funding and other facilities. Primarily this was his idea to have an electronics society in our college but with the efforts of other members we established two other wings - Software and Design.The other seniors who had their valuable contribution for this initiative were: Ankit Mishra, Zighnesh Biswal, Abhishek Dash, Avinash Nayak, Tapan Kumar Pal, Krutikesh Sahoo, Abhilash Das.

            <p>Our club <b>SPECTRUM</b> is so named as it provides us with different wings emitted by the hardwork from
                our members, showing homologous transitions between Hardware, Software and Designing. <br><br>
                The <b>HARDWARE</b> team of the Club mainly focuses on VLSI, Embedded Systems and PCB Design. We have
                developed many projects with implementation and testing of circuits, components, systems, etc.<br><br>
                The <b>SOFTWARE</b> team is continuously striving for growth in the domains of Web Development, App
                Development, Competitive Programming, Machine Learning and Data Science. Working as a team, inspiring
                each other we quickly develop viable solutions for a better outcome.<br><br>
                The <b>DESIGN</b> Wing of our Club has proven their creativity in UI/UX Poster Designing. We believe
                visual
                communication is a major tool to enhance various creative projects.
